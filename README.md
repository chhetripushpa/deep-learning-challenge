# deep-learning-challenge
## Project Overview

Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit foundation, seeks a tool to help identify applicants with the highest likelihood of success in their ventures. Using machine learning and neural networks, this project aims to develop a binary classifier that predicts whether an applicant will succeed if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Objectives

Data Preprocessing: Clean and transform the dataset for machine learning.

Feature Engineering: Select relevant features that influence funding success.

Model Development: Build a neural network model to classify applicants.

Model Evaluation: Assess performance and optimize the model for better accuracy.

## Dataset

The dataset contains over 34,000 records of organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup. Key metadata columns include:

Organization Type

Funding Amount

Project Category

Financial Health Metrics

Success Indicator (Target Variable)

## Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn)

Machine Learning & Neural Networks

Jupyter Notebook for analysis and experimentation

## Project steps

Load and explore the dataset.

Preprocess and encode categorical data.

Build a neural network model using TensorFlow.

Train, test, and optimize the model.

Evaluate model performance and fine-tune hyperparameters.
